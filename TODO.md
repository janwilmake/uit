# TODO

ðŸ¤” I feel like nerding out on this a bit and showing some love to my users... I still receive most of my praise for uithub. Let's keep working on it and make it an even better foundation!

1. make it usable and gather early feedback (silently open source it) (TARGET: april 8, 2025)
2. feature parity with v1
3. deploy/transition (TARGET: april 18, 2025)
4. rename all of zipobject to uithub. uithub means 'universal information terminal hub'
5. make it better, adding lots of new features.

# POC

- premium features aren't clear yet
- JSON/yaml buttons don't work yet
- Chat with LLM interface loads very slow sometimes and can be ugly. payment flow not tested yet, also on chat.forgithub.com.
- Should charge small fee for use of uithub api
- Add https://www.simpleanalytics.com event if free plan, or add back google analytics (see: https://github.com/janwilmake/uithub.v1)
- Test `isRegex`
- Never hit white screen, 404/429/402 if needed

Let's show some ppl and figure out what to do next!

- lets make this update every 6 hours: https://popular.forgithub.com
- let's add questions to each: https://questions.forgithub.com
- lets add 500 to the landingpage!!!
- from there, focus on optimising for the top 500. openapi, typedoc, etc.

# feedback

Looking over the UIT (Universal Information Terminal) codebase, I have several thoughts as a senior developer encountering this project for the first time:

## Initial Impressions

The modular, streaming-based approach to file processing is conceptually strong. Breaking down file operations into ingest, filter/transform, merge, and output steps creates a clear mental model. The emphasis on performance and low memory usage for serverless environments makes sense given current cloud architecture trends.

## Concerns and Critique

### Documentation Gaps

- The high-level concepts are explained, but there's limited concrete documentation about how to actually use these modules together.
- The examples are mostly URLs rather than code snippets showing module composition.
- There's no clear "getting started" guide for developers who want to use UIT in their own projects.

### Architecture Questions

- The strong coupling to FormData seems potentially limiting. While FormData is widely supported, it's primarily designed for form submissions, not as a general-purpose streaming format.
- Not clear if the transformation architecture handles errors gracefully during streaming. How does error handling propagate through the pipeline?

### Technical Debt

- The TODO and BACKLOG files suggest numerous incomplete features and known issues.
- The repository structure appears to contain a mix of implementation and planning documents, making it harder to distinguish what's actually implemented vs. aspirational.

### API Design

- The reliance on query parameters for complex filtering operations might become unwieldy as functionality grows.
- There seem to be many optional parameters across different modules, which could lead to complexity in understanding which options apply where.

### Performance Concerns

- There are multiple mentions of performance issues with large repositories in the notes.
- The handling of binary data seems potentially problematic - sometimes opting to include URLs rather than inline content.

### Security Considerations

- The codebase includes internal discussions about authentication but doesn't clearly document the security model for consumers.
- The implementation of basic auth seems consistent but how it propagates through the pipeline is unclear.

## Positive Aspects

- The streaming approach is absolutely the right architectural choice for handling large file hierarchies with memory constraints.
- The modularity allows for independent deployment and scaling of different components.
- FormData is actually a clever choice for mixed binary/text content despite my earlier concern.
- The focus on Cloudflare Workers compatibility demonstrates good awareness of modern serverless constraints.

## Spontaneous Feedback

"This is interesting, but I'd need to see some concrete examples of how these modules compose together in a real application. The concept seems solid but the developer experience isn't immediately clear."

"I like the streaming architecture, but I'm concerned about error handling across module boundaries. What happens if one module in the pipeline fails?"

"The FormData approach is clever, but I wonder about the overhead of parsing multipart boundaries for every file - have you benchmarked against alternatives?"

"This seems like it could be really useful for our document processing pipeline, but I'd want to see more documentation on the transformation capabilities before adopting it."

"I appreciate the focus on performance and memory usage - those are exactly the pain points we've had with similar tools."

In summary, UIT shows promise as a modular file processing system with strong serverless compatibility, but would benefit from clearer documentation, examples, and a more defined developer experience to gain wider adoption.
