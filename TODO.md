# TODO

ðŸ¤” I feel like nerding out on this a bit and showing some love to my users... I still receive most of my praise for uithub. Let's keep working on it and make it an even better foundation!

1. make it usable and gather early feedback (silently open source it) (TARGET: april 8, 2025)
2. feature parity with v1
3. deploy/transition (TARGET: april 18, 2025)
4. rename all of zipobject to uithub. uithub means 'universal information terminal hub'
5. make it better, adding lots of new features.

# POC before LONDON

- âœ… easy login
- âœ… https://new.uithub.com/owner/repo has new layout
- âœ… search is the biggest feature missing
- Add https://www.simpleanalytics.com event if free plan, or add back google analytics (see: https://github.com/janwilmake/uithub.v1)
- Test `isRegex`
- never hit white screen, 404/429/402 if needed
