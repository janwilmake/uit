Similarly to this example, make a 429 HTML that:

- is assumed to have access to `window.data` with `{owner_login?:string,avatar_url?:string,balance?:number /*balance in USD*/, ratelimitHeaders:{"X-RateLimit-Limit": number /*requests per hour*/,  "X-RateLimit-Remaining": string /* requests remaining */, "X-RateLimit-Reset": string /*unix timestamp in seconds*/ }}`. user info won't be available if not logged in.
- if not logged in, show login button (to /login?scope=user:email&redirect_uri={urlencoded_path_and_query} to login) and privacy policy and terms (linking to privacy.html and tos.html)
- if logged in, it shows user card with balance and link to sponsor more (https://github.com/sponsors/janwilmake) explaining that the limit is X-Ratelimit-Limit requests per hour unless you have a positive balance (sponsor me)
