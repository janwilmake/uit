# Uber uithub (uuithub) - Easily Ask Your LLM Coding Questions

In this repo you can find:

- Usage of the [uit](https://github.com/janwilmake/uit) protocol.
- [Sponsorflare](https://github.com/janwilmake/cloudflare-sponsorware) integration for auth and monetisation
- Smooth 404 and 429 handling with proper login redirects
- More details: https://uuithub.com/openapi.html
- Rendering HTML for browser-usage while offering other formats over `fetch` and `curl`

This is the advanced, new, version of https://uithub.com, made accessible by simply replacing `g` with `uu`. My plan is to migrate to this on `uithub` itself only after it is better than uithub v1 in every way. [Feedback is appreciated](https://x.com/janwilmake)
