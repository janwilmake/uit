Make a new html 404.html in the same style as the example

- it should tell the user the repo could not be found
- it may assume window.data may be available with {owner_login,avatar_url,scope}. it can show this as a card if available. if scope includes repo this means we already have the private repo scope. this should be clear whether or not we have it.
- it should have <pre></pre> somewhere where an error will be shown that does not have horizontal scroll and is as big as it needs to be (this will be replaced by server)
- it should show a CTA to /login?scope=user:email%20repo&redirect_uri={urlencoded_path_and_query} to login to view private repos. if the window.data already contained a user it says "login with another account". if window.data scope indicates invalid permission (no private repos) it should be titled "login with private repo permission". if not logged, it shall just say "login with GitHub"
- below the login it says "by logging in you agree with the terms and privacy policy. this links to privacy.html and tos.html
