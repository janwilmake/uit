in a cloudflare worker how can I elegantly do a 3 requests where the result of the 1st streams into the second, the result of the second streams in the 3rd, and the result of the 3rd streams into the response?

# 2

I want to make this a more generic function where we can stream through as many requests as given in an array. the only real information here that needs to be extracted as parameters is the URL. call it `streamPipe(urls:string[], headers: Record<string,string>):Promise<Response>` and ensure it ultimately returns the response of the last item. show a cloudflare worker example that uses `streamPipe`

This is cool however, I was wondering if we can use a URL Piping technique. I'd just give some base paths, and basically the URL gets built up by doing {origin}/{origin}/{origin}/{origin} etc. every server is assumed to take a base path and use that as the location where the stream is found. This could technically bring about the same result, right? ensure the URLs are able to pass query params independently (url encoded) and assume any provided headers will be passed on from the first.
so fn urlPipe would take `urls:string[], headers?:Record<string,string>

maybe I can require any of the services in the chain to:

- if method: GET , pathname must be a URL to get the streamed body from
- if method: POST, pathname need not be given, and body can be passed directly
  The advantage is, with GET things are more easy to test when making one part of the service. however, for piping I would just use POST and a pipeStream!

```js
// Each service would implement something like this
async function handleRequest(request) {
  let sourceStream;

  if (request.method === "GET") {
    // Extract URL from pathname for testing/direct access
    const urlParam = extractUrlFromPath(request.url);
    if (urlParam) {
      const sourceResponse = await fetch(urlParam);
      sourceStream = sourceResponse.body;
    } else {
      return new Response("No source URL provided", { status: 400 });
    }
  } else if (request.method === "POST") {
    // Use the request body directly in the pipeline
    sourceStream = request.body;
  } else {
    return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
  }

  // Process the stream and return response
  return processStream(sourceStream);
}
```

What if I used Cloudflare service bindings for the services that I own? we can look at the hostname and automatically pick the correct binding incase we have one. rewrite this such that it picks env.SOME_FETCHER.fetch instead of regular fetch incase this is available for a particular hostname.

Result `bindingStreamPipe.ts`
