I'll compare the memory and CPU requirements for both the `streamPipe` and `urlPipe` functions based on their implementations.

## Memory Requirements

### `streamPipe`

- **Higher memory consumption** due to:
  - Creates multiple `TransformStream` objects (one for each connection between requests)
  - Maintains multiple concurrent HTTP connections
  - Buffers data between pipeline stages
  - Stores the entire chain of requests and their outputs in memory
  - For n requests, creates approximately n-1 transform streams

### `urlPipe`

- **Significantly lower memory usage** because:
  - Only makes a single HTTP request
  - No transform streams or data buffering
  - Only stores a single URL string and a single response
  - Memory usage is primarily for the single response object

## CPU Requirements

### `streamPipe`

- **Higher CPU consumption** due to:
  - Multiple request/response cycles (n requests)
  - Data transformation overhead between each request
  - Error handling for each stream connection
  - Pipeline management
  - Complex data flow management across multiple streams

### `urlPipe`

- **Much lower CPU usage** because:
  - Single request/response cycle
  - Simple string concatenation for URL building
  - Minimal error handling
  - No transformation or streaming overhead

## Scalability Considerations

### `streamPipe`

- Memory and CPU usage scales linearly with the number of requests in the chain
- The example shows 17 requests, which could create significant resource demands
- Performance bottlenecks may appear with many requests or large data transfers

### `urlPipe`

- Resource usage remains relatively constant regardless of the number of base paths
- The only scaling factor is the size of the final URL string, which is negligible

## Summary

`streamPipe` is significantly more resource-intensive in terms of both memory and CPU compared to `urlPipe`. The difference grows with the number of requests in the chain. If performance is a concern, `urlPipe` would be much more efficient, but it also provides less functionality since it doesn't actually pipe request bodies through a chain of services.

The key tradeoff is functionality vs. efficiency - `streamPipe` offers true streaming of data through multiple services but at a higher resource cost, while `urlPipe` is just constructing a nested URL path for a single request.
