# CHANGELOG:

## First version (2025-04-04)

- ✅ Built a working version based on json sequence
- ✅ Refactored it all to FormData
- ✅ Get a perfect example of formdata to formdata. To get this, I need to also improve `multipart-formdata-stream-js` as it does not pass all headers now!
- ✅ Really understand it myself, creating the ability to separate the path filter, content filter, content transform into its own functions.
- ✅ Keep that example as blueprint, maybe as library where I can just pass `{filter, map}`
