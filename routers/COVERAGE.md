# openapisearch.com

OpenAPISearch will provide crawled openapis in converted formats as a agent-supervised dataset. This is high prio and will be coming soon. Reach out if you have specific needs to an openapi dataset.

Here we wanna find a url structure as well that works nicely for domains as well as for github repos. the simplest way is probably:

- decode url
- remove protocol `https?://` (redirect)
- remove `.com` (redirect)
- remove suffix `/openapi.json` (redirect)
- keep a harcoded list of storage domains such as github, npm, etc, that allow alternative name:
  - openapisearch.com/https://github.com/janwilmake/openapisearch/tree/main/openapi.json -> openapisearch/janwilmake_openapisearch.githus
  - openapisearch/janwilmake_openapisearch.githus/handmade/brandwatch.json
