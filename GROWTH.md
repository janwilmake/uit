# Bounty and Open Source Repo List

Put together a list of lists. Every list can be sourced by someone else and turned into a list of URLs of repos with a simple parser.

There aren't any lists on github of repos with bounties

Bounty program Apps:

- https://www.bountyhub.dev
- https://algora.io
- https://www.boss.dev/issues/open

However, we can also assume any open source repo with funding or revenue would give us money if we speed up their development.

- Scrape the bounty program app apis or websites and get to a list of owners and repos with that
- Scrape https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/industry/open-source and find the belonging github owners
- Scrape https://www.ycombinator.com/companies (5000+) and figure out if they have a github repo and have the owner.
- Scrape github's biggest open source repos and figure out if they belong to companies with revenue or funding.

Obviously this will take some time to get to this in an automated way... But it's much faster to start manually creating a single list in a repo readme: https://github.com/janwilmake/awesome-bounty-repos

From here, we need to get to determine which repos are properly suitable for us to navigate in and build proper issue validation.

After I nailed this these filters, I can start cloning repos and solving issues in my cloned repos, and make PRs.

If I add a feature with a "TIP JAR" to every PR I made with a suggested price, the algo can start optimising maximising profit and minimising cost, in other words maximising EV.

Maybe this is too ambitious still, because the repos are actually very large, issues can be complex, and priorisation is hard. Maybe it's better to first focus on my own code of which I know much better how to solve issues.
